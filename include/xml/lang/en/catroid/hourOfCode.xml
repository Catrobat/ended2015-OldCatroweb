	<string name="description1">This task explains how you get "Pocket Code" on your mobile device.</string>
	<string name="description2">In this task you’ll get all the stuff you need for your first program in “Pocket Code”.</string>
	<string name="description3">Let’s look inside the program.</string>
	<string name="description4">You need variables to control the x and y position of your parachute.</string>
	<string name="description5">In this task you name a variable for the x-position of your parachute.</string>
	<string name="description6">In this task you name a variable and set it as starting y-position of your parachute.</string>
	<string name="description7">You need to control the position of your parachute all the time. Therefor you need a "Forever" - loop.</string>
	<string name="description8">You need more bricks inside the "Forever" - loop to control your parachute. You modify the "Place at" - brick so as to control the position of your parachute with the variables "x" an "y".</string>
	<string name="description9">You need to change the y position of your parachute all the time by -3 with the first "Change variable" - brick. The x position of your parachute is controlled by the inclination of your mobile device.</string>
	<string name="description10">You should be able to control the height of your parachute with your mobile device's loudness sensor. Therefor you need to add and modify a "If 1 is true then" - brick.</string>
	<string name="description11">You need to add and change a "When I receive" - brick if you want restart the game with the parachute's initial positions.</string>
	<string name="description12">Now you are done with your first object. The parachute should work fine now, but to play the game we need to modify some more objects. Up next you need to navigate back to the object overview.</string>
	<string name="description13">In this task the object „target“ gets modified. To control your target you need to add the following bricks.</string>
	<string name="description14">If the game is restarted, the target should change the position. Therefor you need to set the x- and y-position by random values.</string>
	<string name="description15">Up next you need to modify the "Place at" - brick in in order, that you can control the position of your target with the variables "goalx" an "goaly".</string>
    
	<string name="description16">The parcel should only be shown when the parcel receives the message "start". Therefor you need to edit the object "parcel". </string>
	<string name="description17">To check if the parcel hits the target, you need a "If 1 is true then"- brick.</string>
	<string name="description18">You should win if a parcel hits the target. In this case you have to fix the position of the parcel and to tell the other objects of your triumph.</string>
	<string name="description19">Now you have to modify the object “restart”. You need to define the position and the behaviour of the object.</string>
	<string name="description20">In this last task, you’ll finish the program by modifying the "background" object and finally you can start playing the game.</string>
