This additional permission is similar to the additional permission for GCC (see the corresponding {*faq_page_for_gcc*} for more information). If the work thus created has an interactive user interface, it must display a note in a screen shown when the user presses an "About" menu button or a similar way to convey such a message that says "This work was created using programs developed by the Catroid project.
