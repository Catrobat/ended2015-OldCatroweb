If you do not agree to any of these terms, the Catroid privacy notice, or the Community Guidelines, please do not use the Service.</string>
  <string name="tos_paragraph_2">Although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to these Terms of Service, you should periodically review the most up-to-date version ({*termsofservice*}). The Catroid team may, in its sole discretion, modify or revise these Terms of Service and policies at any time, and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions.</string>
  <string name="tos_header_2">2. Service</string>
  <string name="tos_paragraph_3">These Terms of Service apply to all users of the Service, including users who are also contributors of Content on the Service. "Content" includes the text, software, scripts, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, audiovisual combinations, interactive features and other materials you may view on, access through, or contribute to the Service. The Service includes all aspects of Catroid, including but not limited to all products, software and services offered via the Catroid website.</string>
  <string name="tos_paragraph_4">The Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by the Catroid team (in the following also called "Catroid"). Catroid has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In addition, Catroid will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site. By using the Service, you expressly relieve Catroid from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website.</string>
  <string name="tos_paragraph_5">Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you leave the Service and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each other website that you visit.</string>
  <string name="tos_header_3">3. Catroid Accounts</string>
  <string name="tos_paragraph_6">In order to access some features of the Service, you will have to create a Catroid account. You may never use another's account without permission.

  <string name="tos_paragraph_12">You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Catroid servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Catroid grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. Catroid reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases.

  <string name="tos_paragraph_32">A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</string>

  <string name="tos_paragraph_36">Your physical or electronic signature;</string>
  <string name="tos_paragraph_37">Identification of the Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the Content appeared before it was removed or disabled;</string>
