		Imagine that each Catroid project is a cake, a very special cake that comes with its recipe (programming blocks).
		All members of the Catroid community share their cakes along with their recipes. This means that you can enjoy the cakes and learn how to make them yourself!
	</string>
	<string name="project_licence_part2">
		There are no secret recipes: the instructions on how to make these cakes are open for anyone to use, reuse, modify, and serve as
        inspiration for new ideas... I mean cakes.
	</string>
	<string name="project_licence_part3">
		You can eat the cakes as well as copy other people's recipes to make your own, maybe with different ingredients.
		This freedom comes with two simple requirements:
	</string>
	<string name="project_licence_part3_list_element1">share your cakes along with the recipe</string>
	<string name="project_licence_part3_list_element2">give credit to those who inspired you</string>
	<string name="project_licence_part4">
		Some people gave a name to this type of sharing: they call it {*shareAlikeLink*}. In setting up the Catroid community,
		we decided to adopt this approach since we believe that it supports learning and creativity within the community. 
        By sharing recipes and ingredients (scripts and artwork), people can build upon one another's ideas and everyone will benefit.
	</string>
	<string name="project_licence_part5">
		In designing the Catroid website, we included features to encourage people to share and to give credit to others. On each project page, you 
        can always download the original scripts for the project. If you remix a project (modifying the scripts or artwork, and sharing the result), 
        we encourage you to give credit in the Project Notes, mentioning the people and projects that inspired you.
