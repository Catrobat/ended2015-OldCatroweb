  <string name="title">Uvjeti korištenja</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_welcome1">Dobrodošao/la u Catrobat zajednicu!</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_welcome2">Kao dio Catrobat zajednice, dijeliš programe i ideje s ljudima:</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_enumeration_1">iz više različitih država i kultura</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_enumeration_2">svih uzrasta (od djece i tinejdžera do baka i dјedova)</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_enumeration_3">sa različitim razinama iskustava</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_your_support">Trebamo tvoju pomoć kako bi ova zajednica bila mjesto podrške za svakog člana. Evo kako možeš pomoći:</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_enumeration_4">Imaj razumijevanja. Prilikom zajedničkog korištenja programa, imaj na umu da ljudi mnogih različitih dobi i porijekla vide tvoj doprinos.</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_enumeration_5">Daj kredit. Slobodno modificiraj programe drugih ljudi - samo pazi da im daš kredit. Jedno mjesto gdje možeš dati kredit je u opisu tvog programa. Molimo pogledaj odlomak, ispod ovog popisa, sa detaljima o modificiranju programa drugih korisnika.</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_enumeration_6">Budi iskren. Ne pretvaraj se da si netko drugi da bi prevario zajednicu.</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_enumeration_7">Čuvaj osobne podatke. Ne dijeli svoju email adresu, broj telefona ili druge osobne podatke za kontakt.</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_enumeration_8">Pomozi održati stranicu ljubaznom. Ako misliš da bi drugi mogli pronaći neki program ili značenje komentara, uvredljivim, previše nasilnim ili na neki drugi način neprikladnim, samo klikni na gumb "prijavi kao neprikladan" i ostavi kratko objašnjenje. Catrobat tim će pregledati izvješće i može ukloniti program, komentar ili objavu.</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_become_a_member">Through the Catrobat project we want to foster cooperation and allow everyone's creativity to combine for the benefit of all of humanity. You also can become an active member of the Catrobat community by giving your programs back to the community as a gift, in the same way as other active members are giving their programs to you:</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_enumeration_9">By uploading a program to our websites, you accept and agree to put this work under certain free licenses of uploaded Catrobat programs. Similar to the free licenses under which the Catrobat system itself is available to you, these free licenses of uploaded Catrobat programs give everyone the right to learn from work previously uploaded by others and to adapt and remix that work to build their own new fascinating games, animations, and other programs. This allows everyone to 'stand on the shoulders of one's peers', one of them being you! Your work will thus benefit the whole world and remain free for everyone to use, a bit similar to text and pictures freely contributed to Wikipedia by volunteers from all over the world. Think of it as your present to humanity: you give to everyone, and all others that upload their work to our websites give to you. Thus an uploaded program is a gift of great value which its owner is giving to you for free, with the condition that you participate in the community on the same terms.</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_enumeration_10">You do not have to accept the gift; if you do, certain rules apply. The benefits of these rules are that you can learn from the work and build upon it to make even cooler stuff yourself, which you can then, e.g., again upload to our websites as your own. Another benefit is that these licenses make sure that you cannot be held liable for any problems arising to others through their use of your program.</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_enumeration_11">One important additional condition is that you clearly give attribution to the authors on whose works you based your own work. At the same time, we will work hard so that your work will be clearly appreciated by others to having been contributed by you, by giving attribution to the unique name you have freely chosen to represent you in Catrobat's community, and by giving others the opportunity to express their gratitude to you in public ways for having given your work to everyone, and in particular to them.</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_enumeration_12">Please consult {*licenseofuploadedprojects*} for the precise legal terms and conditions.</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_our_gift">Naš poklon za tebe:</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_enumeration_13">We offer all our own software and Internet resources related to the Catrobat system, e.g., the software written by the Catrobat team, our websites and Internet resources, our own source code related to the Catrobat system, and all additional included materials such as, e.g., pictures, sounds, and texts, now and in the future to you under Catrobat's free licenses.</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_enumeration_14">These licenses make all parts of Catrobat both free of charge to you as well as free in the sense of giving you the freedom to use them however you like, with only a few restrictions ensuring, among others, that the Catrobat system will forever remain free and useful for everyone.</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_enumeration_15">Please consult {*licenseofsystem*} for the precise legal terms and conditions. The source code of the Catrobat system as well as many other documents and resources are available via {*googlecode*}.</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_our_terms">Naši uvjeti korištenja i usluga:</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_enumeration_16">We reserve the rights to reject, delete, or hide programs, user accounts, and any digital materials uploaded to Catrobat's websites at any time in our sole discretion, for instance if we find that a program contains inappropriate material or that a user infringes on the rights of other persons.</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_enumeration_17">Svi Catrobat softveri i internet sredstva su ponuđeni u nadi da će biti korisni, ali bez jamstva.</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_enumeration_18">Please consult our {*termsofservice*} for precise formulations of above points and some additional legal terms and conditions.</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_enumeration_19">If you, or, if you are below 13 years of age, your parents or legal guardians, are associated with an organization involved in or responsible for dragnet type privacy violations and/or bulk or mass surveillance, then you are not allowed to use our software applications and to access our services. The precise details of this restriction and certain exceptions to it are delineated in Sections 4.a and 4.b on our {*termsofservice*}.</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_enumeration_20">Ako si mlađi od 13 godina, moraš pitati roditelje ili zakonske skrbnike da li će ti oni dopustiti da koristiš Catrobat softver aplikacije i usluge.</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_check_back">Navrati ovdje s vremena na vrijeme, jer mi uvijek pokušavamo da poboljšamo naše uvjete korištenja.</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_mail_us">Molim pošalji sve prijedloge u vezi s ovim uvjetima korištenja na {*mailus*}.</string>
  <string name="terms_of_use_dated">Verzija 1.3, 4 Ožujak 2014</string>
