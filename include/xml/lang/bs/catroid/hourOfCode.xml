	<string name="description0">In the following step-by-step tutorial you learn how to program the behavior of Steve and his parcel. The images below show you how to control Steve during the game. You have to navigate Steve above the target and tap the background to drop the parcel. Good luck...</string>
	<string name="description1">How to install Pocket Code on your mobile device.</string>
	<string name="description2">How to download the essential program allowing you to program “Skydiving Steve”.</string>
	<string name="description3">Let’s look inside the program.</string>
	<string name="description4">The variables x and y allow you to control the position of your parachute.</string>
	<string name="description5">Label the x position of your parachute.</string>
	<string name="description6">Label and set the y starting position of your parachute.</string>
	<string name="description7">You need to control the position of your parachute at all times. Insert a "Forever" - loop to do so.</string>
	<string name="description8">Add more bricks in your "Forever" loop to control your parachute. Inserting the variables x and y in your "Place at" brick enables you to control the position of your parachute. </string>
	<string name="description9">Change the variable y by -3 to let your parachute glide to the ground. Change the variable x so your parachute follows the inclination angle of your mobile device.</string>
	<string name="description10">You can control the height of your parachute with the loudness sensor of your mobile device. To do so, add and modify a "If 1 is true then" brick.</string>
	<string name="description11">When you restart the game, the starting position of your parachute should match your initial starting position. For this you need to add and modify three bricks as shown in the pictures below.</string>
	<string name="description12">You have now successfully finished your "parachute" object! Navigate back to the object overview to modify the next object.</string>
	<string name="description13">Here you start modifying the object „target". Add the bricks to control the position and size of your target.</string>
	<string name="description14">When you restart the game, the position of your target needs to change. For this step, set the variables goalx and goaly with the random function.</string>
	<string name="description15">Modify your "Place at" brick to control the position of your target with the variables goalx an goaly.</string>
	<string name="description16">Here you start modifying your object "parcel". When the object "parcel" receives the message "start", the parcel should be shown. Set the position of parcel with the variables x and y.</string>
	<string name="description17">To check whether the parcel has hit the target, you need the "If 1 is true then" brick.</string>
	<string name="description18">If the parcel has successfully hit the target, you need to modify the position of the parcel.Send a message to the other objects to let them know that you have won.</string>
	<string name="description19">Here you modify the object “restart”. Define the position and the behavior of the object. </string>
	<string name="description20">Complete the program by modifying the "background" object. Now you can start playing your game. Have fun!</string>
	<string name="description21">Click on the images below to enlarge them. Review the scripts of your objects if your game doesn't work correctly.</string>
