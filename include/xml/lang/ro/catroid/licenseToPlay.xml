		You can eat the cakes as well as copy other people's recipes to make your own, maybe with different ingredients.
		This freedom comes with two simple requirements:
	</string>
	<string name="project_licence_part3_list_element1">share your cakes along with the recipe</string>
	<string name="project_licence_part3_list_element2">give credit to those who inspired you</string>
	<string name="project_licence_part4">
		In setting up the Catrobat community, we decided to adopt this approach since we believe that it supports learning and creativity within the community. 
        By sharing recipes and ingredients (scripts and artwork), people can build upon one another's ideas and everyone will benefit.
	</string>
	<string name="project_licence_part5">
		In designing the Catrobat website, we included features to encourage people to share and to give credit to others. On each program page, you 
        can always download the original scripts for the program. If you remix a program (modifying the scripts or artwork, and sharing the result), 
        we encourage you to give credit in the Program Notes, mentioning the people and program that inspired you.
