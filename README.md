Catroweb
=========

**Catroweb** is the name of Catroid community website for the associated [Catrobat](https://github.com/Catrobat/) project. 

The website features Catrobat projects (also called Catrobat programs) uploaded directly from Catroid. These projects can be downloaded and opened in Catroid, for execution on one's Android device and also for remixing. Further functionality such as commenting, forums, a wiki and many others are planned.

The Community website with sample programs can be found at [http://www.catroid.org](http://www.catroid.org/).
