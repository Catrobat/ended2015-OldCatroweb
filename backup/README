setup backup server:

  * make sure keychain is installed (apt-get install keychain)
  * create a public and private key for ssh (ssh-keygen -t rsa)
    don't use a passphrase, if you don't want to enter the passphrase after
    every reboot
  * copy your public key to catroidweb and catroidwebtest
      # ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub unpriv@catroidweb.ist.tugraz.at
      # ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub unpriv@catroidwebtest.ist.tugraz.at
  * try to connect to catroidwebtest.ist.tugraz.at, use following commands:
      # keychain $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa
      # source $HOME/.keychain/$HOSTNAME-sh 
      # ssh unpriv@catroidweb.ist.tugraz.at "date +%F,%k:%M"
    you should receive the current date and time without typing your password in
  * add the backup routine to the cronjob list (check your file paths and be
    sure they are executable!!!)
      # crontab entry.cron

restore backup:

  * run restore_catroweb_backup.sh with desired backup file as parameter
    e.g. restore_catroweb_backup.sh data/catroweb-Friday.tgz
  * run restore_pootle_backup.sh with desired backup file as parameter
    e.g. restore_pootle_backup.sh data/pootle-Friday.tgz
  
  Again, be sure that all file paths are set correct and your connection to the
  server works without entering the password.
  
For the backup username and password have a look into our TWiki (Catroweb / Hints/ Backup)!!!
