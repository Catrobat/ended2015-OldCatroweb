PHPUnit 3.5
===========

This is the list of changes for the PHPUnit 3.5 release series.

PHPUnit 3.5.10
--------------

* Fixed GH-71: `PHPUnit_Framework_TestSuite::addTestFile()` has problems identifying the correct test suite.
* Fixed GH-120: Printer class does not handle "file does not exist" problems correctly.
* Fixed GH-125: Work around [PHP bug #47987](http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=47987).

PHPUnit 3.5.9
-------------

* Fixed GH-17: Process Isolation breaks for global objects that implement the `Serializable` interface.
* Fixed GH-64: `./` added to path to test when using PHPUnit on Windows terminal.
* Fixed GH-104: Bootstrap must be relative to the current directory.

PHPUnit 3.5.8
-------------

* Fixed GH-84: If no assertions are made the code should not be marked as covered.
* Fixed GH-115: Make most of the attributes in `PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase` private.

PHPUnit 3.5.7
-------------

* Implemented GH-103: Improved handling of deprecated PHPUnit features.
* Fixed GH-100: `assertSame()` does not give useful output on misordered arrays.
* Fixed GH-105: Backup of static attributes causes memory exhaustion.
* The TextUI test runner now prints the normal progress output in verbose mode.

PHPUnit 3.5.6
-------------

* Properly marked `assertType()` and `assertNotType()` as well as `assertAttributeType()` and `assertAttributeNotType()` as deprecated. These assertions will removed in PHPUnit 3.6 and should no longer be used. `assertInternalType()` should be used for asserting internal types such as `integer` or `string` whereas `assertInstanceOf()` should be used for asserting that an object is an instance of a specified class or interface.

PHPUnit 3.5.4

* Refactored test dependency handling (required for a bugfix in `PHPUnit_Selenium`).
* Fixed `--stop-on-failure`.

PHPUnit 3.5.3
-------------

* Fixed GH-13: Result XML inconsistent when data provider returns empty array or does not exist.
* Fixed the skeleton generator for tested classes.
* Strict mode is now compatible with process isolation.

* Added a ticket listener that interacts with the GitHub issue API.

* Added the `--strict` switch to mark tests that perform no assertions as incomplete.
* The paths in the XML configuration file can now be relative to the directory that contains the XML configuration file.

* The `PHPUnit_Extensions_SeleniumTestCase::$autoStop` flag has been removed, please start Selenium RC with `-browserSessionReuse` instead.
* The `--log-metrics` and `--log-pmd` switches have been removed. Their functionality has been or will be merged into [PHP_Depend](http://pdepend.org/) and [PHPMD](http://phpmd.org/). Details can be found [here](http://sebastian-bergmann.de/archives/744-On-PHPUnit-and-Software-Metrics.html).

* `PHPUnit_Extensions_TicketListener_Trac` has been removed.
* The `PHPUnit_Extensions_Story_TestCase` functionality has been deprecated.
* Replaced `PHPUnit_Framework_MockObject` with the [PHPUnit_MockObject](http://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-mock-objects) component.
* Replaced `PHPUnit_Extensions_Database_TestCase` with the [DbUnit](http://github.com/sebastianbergmann/dbunit) component.
* Replaced `PHPUnit_Extensions_SeleniumTestCase` with the [PHPUnit_Selenium](http://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-selenium) component.
* Replaced `PHPUnit_Util_FilterIterator` with the [PHP_FileIterator](http://github.com/sebastianbergmann/php-file-iterator) component.
* Replaced `PHPUnit_Util_Template` with the [Text_Template](http://github.com/sebastianbergmann/php-text-template) component.
* Replaced `PHPUnit_Util_Timer` with the [PHP_Timer](http://github.com/sebastianbergmann/php-timer) component.
* Fixed TRAC-1068: `assertSame()` on two floats does not print the error message.
* Fixed GH-7: Code paths that create a `PHPUnit_Framework_Warning` end up serializing/unserializing globals unconditionally.
* PHPUnit now requires PHP 5.2.7 (or later) but PHP 5.3.3 (or later) is highly recommended.

* `PHPUnit/Framework.php` should no longer be included by test code. If needed, include `PHPUnit/Autoload.php` to make PHPUnit's autoloader available.
