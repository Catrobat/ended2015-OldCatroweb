Welcome to the Catroid community! As part of the Catroid community, you are sharing projects and ideas with people:
<ul>
<li>from many different countries and cultures
<li>of all ages (from young children to teens and grandparents)
<li>with all levels of experience
</ul>
<br/>
We need your help to make this community a supportive place for every member. Here's how you can help:
<ul>
<li>Be respectful. When sharing projects, please remember that people of many different ages and backgrounds will see your contributions.
<li>Give credit. Feel free to make modified versions of other people's projects - just make sure to give them credit. One place to give credit is in your project description. Please see the paragraph below this dotted list for details about modifying projects of other users.
<li>Be honest. Don't pretend to be someone other than who you are or try to trick the community.
<li>Keep personal information private. Don't share your email address, phone number, or other personal contact information.
<li>Help keep the site friendly. If you feel others would find a project or comment mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate, just click the 'report as inappropriate' button and leave a short explanation. The Catroid team will review your report and may remove any project, comment, or post.
</ul>
<br/>

Through Catroid we want to foster cooperation and allow everyone's creativity to combine for the benefit of all of humanity. You also can become an active member of the Catroid community by giving your projects back to the community as a gift, in the same way as other active members are giving their projects to you: 
<ul>
<li>By uploading a project to Catroid's website, you accept and agree to put this work under certain free licenses of uploaded Catroid projects. Similar to the free licenses under which the Catroid system itself is available to you, these free licenses of uploaded Catroid projects give everyone the right to learn from work previously uploaded by others and to adapt and remix that work to build their own new fascinating games, animations, and other programs. This allows everyone to "stand on the shoulders of one's peers", one of them being you! Your work will thus benefit the whole world and remain free for everyone to use, a bit similar to text and pictures freely contributed to Wikipedia by volunteers from all over the world. Think of it as your present to humanity: you give to everyone, and all others that upload their work to Catroid's website give to you. Thus an uploaded project is a gift of great value which its owner is giving to you for free, with the condition that you participate in the community on the same terms. 
<li>You do not have to accept the gift; if you do, certain rules apply. The benefits of these rules are that you can learn from the work and build upon it to make even cooler stuff yourself, which you can then, e.g., again upload to Catroid's website as your own. Another benefit is that these licenses make sure that you cannot be held liable for any problems arising to others through their use of your project. 
<li>One important additional condition is that you clearly give attribution to the authors on whose works you based your own work. At the same time, we will work hard so that your work will be clearly appreciated by others to having been contributed by you, by giving attribution to the unique name you have freely chosen to represent you in Catroid's community, and by giving others the opportunity to express their gratitude to you in public ways for having given your work to everyone, and in particular to them. 
<li>Please consult <a href="/catroid/licenseofuploadedprojects">http://www.catroid.org/catroid/licenseofuploadedprojects</a> for the precise legal terms and conditions.
</ul>
<br/>

Our gift to you:
<ul>
<li>We offer all our own software and Internet resources related to the Catroid system, e.g., Catroid itself, Paintroid, the Catroid websites and Internet resources, our own source code related to the Catroid system, and all additional included materials such as, e.g., pictures, sounds, and texts, now and in the future to you under Catroid's free licenses.
<li>These licenses make all parts of Catroid both free of charge to you as well as free in the sense of giving you the freedom to use them however you like, with only a few restrictions ensuring, among others, that the Catroid system will forever remain free and useful for everyone. 
<li>Please consult <a href="/catroid/licenseofsystem">http://www.catroid.org/catroid/licenseofsystem</a> for the precise legal terms and conditions. The source code of the Catroid system as well as many other documents and resources are available at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/catroid" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/catroid</a>.
</ul>
<br/>

Our terms of service:
<ul>
<li>We reserve the rights to reject, delete, or hide projects, user accounts, and any digital materials uploaded to Catroid's website at any time in our sole discretion, for instance if we find that a project contains inappropriate material or that a user infringes on the rights of other persons.  
<li>All of Catroid's Internet resources are offered in the hope that they will be useful, but without any warranty. 
<li>Please consult our <a href="/catroid/termsofservice">http://www.catroid.org/catroid/termsofservice</a> for precise formulations of above points and some additional legal terms and conditions.
</ul>
<br/>
Check back here from time-to-time, because we are always trying to improve our terms of use. <br/>
<br/>
Please mail any suggestions regarding these Terms of Use to <a href="mailto:webmaster@catroid.org?subject=Terms%20of%20Use">webmaster@catroid.org</a>.
