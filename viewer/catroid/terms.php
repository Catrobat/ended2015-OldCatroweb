            	      Welcome to the Catroid community!
					As part of the Catroid community, you are sharing projects and ideas with people:
					<br>
					</p>
					<ul>
					  <li>from many different countries and cultures</li>
					  <li>of all ages (from young children to teens and grandparents)</li>
					  <li>with all levels of experience</li>
					</ul>
<p class ="licenseText">We need your help to make this community a supportive place for every member. Here's how you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be respectful. When sharing projects remember that people of many different ages and backgrounds will see your contributions.</li>
<li>Give credit. Feel free to make modified versions of other people's projects - just make sure to give them credit. One place to give credit is in your Project description.</li>
<li>Be honest. Don't pretend to be someone other than who you are or try to trick the community.</li>
<li>Keep personal information private. Don't share your email address, phone number, or other personal contact information.</li>

<li>Help keep the site friendly. If you feel others would find a project or comment mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate,  
click the link that says <i>"report as inappropriate"</i>. The Catroid team will review, and may remove any project, comment or post.</li>
