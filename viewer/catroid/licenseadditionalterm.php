<span class="licenseHeader">under section 7 of the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3, for the parts of the Catroid system necessary for running a Catroid project</span>
Version 1.0, 26 October 2011</br>
</br>
Copyright &copy; 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <a href="http://fsf.org" target="_blank">http://fsf.org</a></br>
Copyright &copy; 2011 Catroid Team <a href="http://catroid.org">http://catroid.org</a></br>
</br>
This &quot;Additional Term&quot; exception for the &quot;Parts of the Catroid System Necessary for Running a Catroid Project&quot; is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3 (&quot;AGPLv3&quot;). It applies to parts of the Catroid system bearing a notice placed by the copyright holder stating that these parts are governed by AGPLv3 along with this Additional Term.</br>
</br>
When you use the Catroid system to compile a stand-alone application of a Catroid project, the Catroid system combines portions of the Parts of the Catroid System Necessary for Running a Catroid Project and the Catroid project which you provided, in form of a stand-alone application. The purpose of this Additional Term is to allow compilation of a non-AGPL (including proprietary) program to use, in this way, the Parts of the Catroid System Necessary for Running a Catroid Project.</br>
</br>
<span class="licenseHeader">0. Definitions.</span></br>
</br>
A file is an &quot;Independent Module&quot; if it either requires the Parts of the Catroid System Necessary for Running a Catroid Project for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by the Parts of the Catroid System Necessary for Running a Catroid Project, but is not otherwise based on the Parts of the Catroid System Necessary for Running a Catroid Project.</br>
</br>
&quot;Parts of the Catroid System Necessary for Running a Catroid Project&quot; mean a version of the parts of the Catroid system necessary for running a Catroid project, with or without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.</br>
&quot;AGPL-compatible Software&quot; is software whose conditions of propagation, modification, and use would permit combination with the Catroid system in accord with the licenses of the Catroid system.</br>
</br>
&quot;Catroid Project Stand-Alone Application&quot; refers to output from any part of the Catroid system starting from a given Catroid project for a real or virtual target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input to an assembler, compiler, interpreter, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Catroid Project Stand-Alone Application does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used for producing a compiler intermediate representation.</br>
</br>
The &quot;Compilation Process&quot; transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java Virtual Machine or Dalvik-compatible byte code, into a Catroid Project Stand-Alone Application. Thus, for example, use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.</br>
</br>
A Compilation Process is &quot;Eligible&quot; if it is done using the Catroid system, alone or with other AGPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based on the Catroid system. For example, using non-AGPL-compatible Software to optimize any intermediate representations for the Catroid system would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.</br>
</br>
<span class="licenseHeader">1. Grant of Additional Permission.</span></br>
</br>
You have permission to propagate a Catroid Project Stand-Alone Application formed by combining the Parts of the Catroid System Necessary for Running a Catroid Project with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of AGPLv3, provided that the Catroid Project Stand-Alone Application was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.</br>
</br>
<span class="licenseHeader">2. No Weakening of the Catroid system&apos;s Copyleft.</span></br>
</br>
The availability of this Additional Term does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the licenses of the Catroid system.</br>
